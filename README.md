Built with Django for email sending functionality :)

Most Django functionality was ripped out. You thought NoSQL was web-scale? How about NoDB?? (wait, actually that's [a thing](https://github.com/Miserlou/NoDB))

Static files served with [whitenoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/#infrequently-asked-questions) since S3 would be overkill.
